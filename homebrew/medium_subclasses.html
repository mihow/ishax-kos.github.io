	<h3 class=arch>Seance</h3>
	<p>At 1st level, you can cast speak with dead as a 10 minute ritual. This does not count against your spells known. The rite must within 30 feet of the subject’s corpse and cannot have been dead for more than 30 hours. Alternatively the ritual must be cast within a place the spirit still haunts. Instead of speaking from the subject’s corpse through animating energies, the spirit enters your body and speaks through your own mouth.</p>
	<p>At 6th level, there is no longer a time restriction. The rite can be performed within 30 feet of the subject’s mortal remains, a well-made memorial or enshrinement to the spirit or the subject’s place of death. The ritual can also be performed with an item of great sentimental value to the subject in hand.

	</p>
	<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
	
	<h3 class=arch>Extradimensional Reach</h3>
	<p>At 10th level your spells and medium rites affect creatures regardless of where they fall between and within the material and ethereal planes.

	<h3 class=arch>Shiqq Mediator</h3>
	<p>At 1st level, you gain the services of a shiqq. In exchange, you partake in a ritual to some day make the shiqq whole. You do this by imbuing it with the elements around you, and a portion of yourself. This forever binds the shiqq to you, and allows it to take shape as you grow stronger. For this opportunity, the shiqq acts as a go-between to the elemental planes, returning with any spell you desire. Once per long rest, you can request one spell you have heard of that is of 1st level The shiqq will take an amount of time depending on where it came from. You may cast the spell the same round it arrives, but you cannot hold it longer than 30 minutes. These spells do not cost spell slots to be cast, however you may only ever hold one at any given time.</p>
	
	<div class=sidebar>
		<h4 id="Sidebar: Shiqqun">"Huh? What are 'Shiqqun'?"</h4>
		<div class=sbBody>
			<p>Shiqqun are lesser djinn that have only half formed. As a result of this tragedy, they are often hideous and small; they are pitied by djinn across the elemental planes. A shiqq is not skilled in magic or combat itself, and will therefore rarely fully enter the material plane to interact with others besides it's sha'ir.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<p>If the spell is on the spell list of those who borrow from nature around them, or their own nature such as either the druid, ranger, or sorcerer, the retrieval takes 1d6 rounds + the spell’s level. If the spell is not on the previous, but is a studied magic such as those on the bard, medium, or wizard’s spell lists, the retrieval time is 1d12 rounds + the spell’s level. If the spell can only be cast by those who devote themselves such as a cleric, paladin, or warlock, the retrieval takes 2d12 minutes per level of the spell.

	<h3 class=arch>Mephit Growth</h3>
	<p>At 6th level, the shiqqan’s form is finally made whole. Your mediator takes the form of a mephit companion. The type of mephit it becomes is often dependant on where the original ritual was cast, where you have traveled since, or even your own nature; but this is not guaranteed. Your shiqq companion crawls its way into the material plane as it transforms and gains all the benefits of your Companion’s Bond and bonus cantrips abilities. You can have only one mephit companion at a time.</p>
	<p>Your shiqq or mephit companion is sure to tell you that if it ever dies, with 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and incense it can be resurrected.</p>
	<h4>Companion's Bond</h4>
	<p>This mephit gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.</p>
	<p>The mephit obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, the mephit acts on its own.</p>
	<p>The mephit has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. The mephit uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, a mephit companion also adds this proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls. As you gain levels, the mephit companion also gains additional hit dice and increases its hit points accordingly. The mephit companion has a number of hit die equal to your level.
	</p>
	<p>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, the mephit’s abilities also improve. The mephit can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, the mephit can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.
	</p>
	<p>The mephit gains proficiency in one skill of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.
	</p>
	<p>The mephit shares your alignment, though it’s personality traits and impulses are influenced by the behaviors mentioned in it’s monster entry. The mephit is prone to take on your ideal, and is willing to suffer on your behalf within reason.
	</p>
	<p>The mephit can retrieve spells for you once per short rest. You can request one spell of any level for which you have spell slots, though you need not have any remaining.
	</p>
	<h4>Bonus Cantrips</h4>
	<p>You and the mephit both gain two cantrips depending on what kind of mephit it is.</p>
