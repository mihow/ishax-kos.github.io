                A creature with the "Incorporeal Movement" Ability cannot use this ability to better move through your square. your unarmed strikes count as magical against creatures that are listed as being resistant to "Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing From Nonmagical Attacks" (ghosts and some elementals for example).

            </div>
            <p>
                You dedicate yourself to a single spirit. When channeling this spirit, you gain your full proficiency bonuses when using the spirit's skills as well as twice your proficiency bonus in skills and with weapons you both have proficiency with. With all other spirits you must take on a taboo, or the normal benifits of channeling are not gained. Time spent channeling your primary spirit does not count towards your maximum time, but running out of time while channeling another spirit will prevent you from channeling your primary spirit.

            <h3>Symbiosis</h3>
            <p>
                When you take on a taboo for a channeled spirit, your body physically changes, taking on prominant feature of its appearance (you need not take on its appearance in full). In addition, you can cast the disguise self spell at will, but only to appear as your channeled spirit. The image appears at full scale despite the limitations of the spell. When you choose this rite you must choose two options from attack, defence, movement, or senses this decision cannot be changed. You gain one of the following benifits depending on your choice:
                <p><strong>Attack:</strong> If the spirit had any natural weapons, you gain those weapons. These deal 1d6 damage, and have the finesse property.</p>
                <p><strong>Defence:</strong> If the spirit had any natural armor, you gain natural armor and have an armor class of 13 + plus your Dexterity modifier.</p>
                <p><strong>Movement:</strong> If the spirit had a climb or swim speed, you temporarily gain a coresponding 30ft climb or swim speed, as well as any abilities that improve its ability to move on specific surfaces such as webs or difficult terrain. </p>
                <p><strong>Sense:</strong> If the spirit has an ability that gives it advantage on wisdom (perception) checks in certain scenarios such as keen scent, you gain that ability.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can take rite multiple times, but you must choose two new options each time.
